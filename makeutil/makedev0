#	b_cgen makefile
#
# For use in development - should reside in development source library.
# Assumes standard location of b_cgen, b_cgen components & CMS subs.
# Custom subs (static linkage) may reside in development library.
#
# Stepped makes support bas to executable & anything in between.
# No clean-up is performed after these makes to allow debugging
# & more efficient development.
# For instance, when working on a subroutine, make the driver to .o,
# then fully make the sub each time, but only re-link the driver.
# The .c .h .o are left behind for use in xdb, but this may require
# strategic use of touch & remove to recompile & relink properly.

# Path to normal b_cgen, its components & application subs

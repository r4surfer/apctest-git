            * PLOWCODE -  This subroutine is very similar to the GETCODE*~
            *             subroutine in that it is a combination verify *~

            *             files.  This routine differs primarily by     *~
            *             restricting the inquiry to a range of key     *~
            *             values (similiar to the PLOW logic) and by its*~
            *             use of sophisticated windowing techniques.    *~
